          In the modernn era where every single piece if information can be
          found online,there isn'nt much value to the information available in
          library.Students mostlly can get any sort of information which they
          need, but over library the choose to get the information from
          internet,as internet serves the information fast and provides more
          options than any book would.Today's Generation of Kids should know the
          history of India.It would be very intresting to know about their
          ancestors.Considering these facts, here we decided to make a world
          history encyclopedia on a website to help any person get any
          infromation related to history.This website is favourable and made
          considering every kind of person i.e. a Stuent,a Teacher,a
          Professor,or any other noraml person who wishes to know more about the
          history of our country.
