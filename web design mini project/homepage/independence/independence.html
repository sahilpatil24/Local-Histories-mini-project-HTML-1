          A Short Note on First War Of Indian Independence
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The first war of independence was witnessed in the year 1857. This
          freedom struggle for the Indian citizens is considered one of the most
          defining moments. The East India Company’s Indian soldiers’ reaction
          to the new cartridge they had to use caused this series of events. The
          British government was seizing numerous states, kingdoms and taking
          land taxes. The displeasure caused by this tax became another chief
          reason behind the events that followed. People wanted to get rid of
          foreign rule and gain freedom from the British individuals.

          Cause of the first war of independence against the British
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The introduction of the Enfield rifle became the chief reason behind
          the triggering of the first war of independence. Before being loaded
          into the gun, the cartridge had to be removed. It was believed that
          the Indian soldiers greased the cartridge. They believed that the
          grease used was made from cow or pig fat. Harming these animals was
          against the sentiments of Muslim and Hindu individuals. The revolt of
          1857 began from this point onwards. The Indian sepoys were enraged
          against the British due to the 'Enfield' rifle.

        <ol type="1" class="">
          <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
            Economic reasons: the peasants were affected heavily by the reforms
            in the revenue system and the taxation. Several administrative
            policies were introduced and imposed by the British government to
            expand their territory.
          </li>
          <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
            Political cause: the unjust policies due to the British expansion
            caused the loss of power of the Zamindars and the Nawabs in various
            places across India. The unfair policies such as the policy of
            indirect subordination, Trade and Commerce, and the policy of war
            and annexation made the rulers the victims of expansion by the
            British.

          Why did the revolt of 1857 collapse?
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The revolt of 1857 began with the purpose of ousting the British from
          India, but the purpose remained unfulfilled due to the following
          reasons:
        </p>
        <ol type="1" class="">
          <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
            Three presidencies of Bombay, Madras, and Bengal remained unaffected
            for the most part. Northern India was affected majorly by this
            revolt.
          </li>
          <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
            No plan for after the defeat of the British was prepared by the
            leaders of the revolt of 1857. They did not envision any plan.
          </li>
          <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
            No coherent plan was followed for getting the British to leave
            India. Other than the lack of coherency, a single leader was
            lacking. This movement was followed by many leaders across different
            parts of India.

                This revolt exposed the hollowness of the East India company’s
                rule in India. The British government decided to abolish the
                rule of the East India Company since it could not afford to lose
                India by hook or crook. After this, the British Parliament
                guided the direct government that was installed.
              </li>
              <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
                The backbone of British rule in India was shaken to its roots
                due to the intensity of the revolt in 1857. Even though the
                revolt remained confined to smaller parts, the intensity caused
                by it was huge.
              </li>
              <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
                It proved that the East India Company was just a trading
                organisation that did not have the ability and efficiency to
                tackle the Indian administration.
              </li>
              <li class="paragraph m-b-small">
                The rule of East India Company in India for over 100 years
                marked the zenith of exploitation. The exploitation by the
                British marked all directions, that is, economic, political, and
                social.

        This article has been written to shed light on the first war of
        independence against the British in 1857. The causes behind the
        triggering of the revolt of 1857, the impact of the war, the leaders of
        the first war of independence against the British, and why the revolt
        failed in getting them to leave India have been mentioned in the article
        written above. Multiple religious, economic, political, and social
        reasons were behind the beginning of this movement that could not fulfil
        its purpose but still left a wave of freedom.
