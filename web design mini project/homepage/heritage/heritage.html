            India is a treasure trove of heritage and culture and is one of the
            few countries in the world where the past remains inextricably
            linked to the present. The wealth of heritage spanning the ages, in
            terms of personalities, monuments, architecture, arts & crafts,
            history and culture cannot be measured. And yet, there is a dearth
            of information about our heritage available to the lay person. Our
            company is striving hard to fulfill this need.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Owing to its rich heritage and culture, India is probably the only
            country in the world where the past remains inextricably linked to
            our present. We at Heritage India advocate value, respect, and a
            sense of pride and belonging with space where this history was
            created. Our work manifests authenticity, quality, pride,
            responsibility, and fun.

          Introduction:
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The rich heritage of India, one of the worldâ€™s oldest civilizations,
          is an all-embracing confluence of religions, traditions and customs.
          The highlights of Indian heritage lie in the treasure of its art,
          architecture, classical dance, music, flora and fauna, and the innate
          secular philosophy of its people. A visit to the heritage sites is
          like a walk through history, changing lanes with every dynasty that
          ruled Indian soils. The finesse of Indian handiwork, the richness of
          silk and cotton textiles, the ethnicity of jewellery, everything has
          come down as a heritage from ancient times and is being kept alive
          generation after generation. Even food in India is a legacy and part
          of Indian heritage, differing in look and taste in every state of
          India.

          Indian Heritage: A Gift from the Older Generations
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Heritage means what we inherit from our ancestors and from our past.
          India is a land of varied cultures and traditions. People from
          numerous castes, religions, and creeds reside in our country. Each
          ethnic group in our country has its own tale of origin and its set of
          unique traditions and culture. They have all contributed to the making
          of Indian history and culture. Nature has made India into a distinct
          geographical entity.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Indian heritage and culture are vast and vivid because of the large
          number of religious groups residing in our country. Every community
          has its own set of customs and traditions which it passes on to its
          younger generation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          However, some of our customs and traditions remain the same throughout
          IndiaOur traditions teach us to inculcate good habits and make us a
          good human being. Our cultural heritage is thus a beautiful gift from
          our older generation that will help us become a better human being and
          build a harmonious society.

          Respect for our Indian Heritage
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The elders should take responsibility to invoke love for the Indian
          heritage in the younger generations. This must be done from the very
          beginning only then we can preserve our rich heritage. It is the duty
          of the elders to invoke love for the Indian heritage in the younger
          generations. This must be done from the very beginning only then we
          can preserve our rich heritage. Schools must teach students about
          Indian heritage and how it has survived for centuries. They must also
          share the importance of preserving it. This would help in invoking a
          feeling of pride in them and they would be inspired to continue the
          tradition and also pass it on to the new generation. This needs a
          collective effort by the teachers as well as parents.
