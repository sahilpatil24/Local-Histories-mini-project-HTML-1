        <p class="paragraph">
          The Gupta Empire stretched across northern, central and parts of
          southern India between c. 320 and 550 CE. The period is noted for its
          achievements in the arts, architecture, sciences, religion, and
          philosophy. Chandragupta I (320 – 335 CE) started a rapid expansion of
          the Gupta Empire and soon established himself as the first sovereign
          ruler of the empire. It marked the end of 500 hundred years of
          domination of the provincial powers and resulting disquiet that began
          with the fall of the Mauryas. Even more importantly, it began a period
          of overall prosperity and growth that continued for the next two and
          half centuries which came to be known as a “Golden Age” in India's
          history. But the seed of the empire was sown at least two generations
          earlier than this when Srigupta, then only a regional monarch, set off
          the glory days of this mighty dynasty in circa 240 CE.

          Gupta Period - Early Days to the Zenith
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Not much is known about the early days of this Gupta dynasty. The
          travel diaries and writings of Buddhist monks who frequented this part
          of the world are the most trustworthy sources of information we have
          about those days. The travelogues of Fa Hien (Faxian, circa 337 – 422
          CE), Hiuen Tsang (Xuanzang, 602 – 664 CE) and Yijing (I Tsing, 635 –
          713 CE) prove to be invaluable in this respect. The Gupta Empire
          during the rule of Srigupta (circa 240 – 280 CE) comprised only
          Magadha and probably a part of Bengal too. Like the Mauryas and other
          Magadha kings who preceded him, Srigupta ruled from Pataliputra, close
          to modern day Patna. Srigupta was succeeded to the throne by his son
          Ghatotkacha (circa 280 – 319 CE).

                  From the Kushans, the Gupta kings learned the benefit of maintaining a
                  cavalry and Chandragupta I, son of Ghatotkacha, made effective use of
                  his strong army. Through his marriage with Licchhavi Princess
                  Kumaradevi, Chandragupta I received the ownership of rich mines full
                  of iron ore adjacent to his kingdom. Metallurgy was already at an
                  advanced stage and forged iron was not only used to meet the internal
                  demands, but also became a valuable trade commodity. The territorial
                  heads ruling over various parts of India could not counter the
                  superior armed forces of Chandragupta I and had to surrender before
                  him. It is conjectured that at the end of his reign, the boundary of
                  the Gupta Empire already extended to Allahabad.

        <h3 class="secondary-heading-b">Samudragupta</h3>
        <p class="paragraph no-margin">
          Samudragupta (circa 335 – 375 CE), Chandragupta I's son who ascended
          the throne next, was a military genius and he continued the growth of
          the kingdom. After conquering the remainder of North India,
          Samudragupta turned his eyes to South India and added a portion of it
          to his empire by the end of his Southern Campaign. It is generally
          believed that during his time the Gupta Empire spanned from the
          Himalayas in north to the mouth of Krishna and Godavari rivers in the
          South, from Balkh, Afghanistan in the west to the Brahmaputra River in
          the east.
        </p> 
          <p class="paragraph">
          Samudragupta was very attentive to rajdharma (duties of a king) and
          took special care to follow Kautilya's (350 – 275 BCE) Arthashastra
          (an economic, social and political treatise that has clear
          instructions about how a monarchy should be governed) closely. He
          donated large sums of money for various philanthropic purposes,
          including the promotion of education. Besides being a courageous king
          and able administrator, he was a poet and musician. The large number
          of gold coins circulated by him showcases his multifaceted talent. An
          inscription, probably commissioned by subsequent Gupta kings, known as
          the Allahabad Pillar is most eloquent about his humane qualities.
          Samudragupta also believed in promoting goodwill among various
          religious communities. He gave, for example, Meghavarna, king of
          Ceylon, permission and support for the construction of a monastery in
          Bodh Gaya.

        <h3 class="secondary-heading-b">Chandragupta II</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A short struggle for power appears to have ensued after the reign of
          Samudragupta. His eldest son Ramagupta became the next Gupta king.
          This was noted by 7th century CE Sanskrit author Banbhatta in his
          biographical work, Harshacharita. What followed next forms a part of
          Sanskrit poet and playwright Visakh Dutta's drama Devi Chandra Guptam.
          As the story goes, Ramagupta was soon overcome by a Scythian king of
          Mathura. But the Scythian king, besides the kingdom itself, was
          interested in Queen Dhruvadevi who was also a renowned scholar. To
          maintain peace Ramagupta gave up Dhruvadevi to his opponent. It is
          then Ramagupta's younger brother Chandragupta II with a few of his
          close aides went to meet the enemy in disguise. He rescued Dhruvadevi
          and assassinated the Scythian king. Dhruvadevi publicly condemned her
          husband for his behaviour. </p><p class="paragraph">Eventually, Ramagupta was killed by
          Chandragupta II who also married Dhruvadevi sometime later. Like
          Samudragupta, Chandragupta II (circa 380 – 414 CE) was a benevolent
          king, able leader and skilled administrator. By defeating the satrap
          of Saurashtra, he further expanded his kingdom to the coastline of the
          Arabian Sea. His courageous pursuits earned him the title of
          Vikramaditya. To rule the vast empire more efficiently, Chandragupta
          II founded his second capital in Ujjain. He also took care to
          strengthen the navy. The seaports of Tamralipta and Sopara
          consequently became busy hubs of maritime trade. He was a great patron
          of art and culture too. Some of the greatest scholars of the day
          including the navaratna (nine gems) graced his court. Numerous
          charitable institutions, orphanages and hospitals benefitted from his
          generosity. Rest houses for travellers were set up by the road side.
          The Gupta Empire reached its pinnacle during this time and
          unprecedented progress marked all areas of life.

        <h3 class="secondary-heading-b">Politics & Administration</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Not much is known about the early days of this Gupta dynasty. The
          Great tact and foresight were shown in the governance of the vast
          empire. The efficiency of their martial system was well known. The
          large kingdom was divided into smaller pradesha (provinces) and
          administrative heads were appointed to take care of them. The kings
          maintained discipline and transparency in the bureaucratic process.
          Criminal law was mild, capital punishment was unheard of and judicial
          torture was not practised. Fa Hien called the cities of Mathura and
          Pataliputra as picturesque with the latter being described as a city
          of flowers. People could move around freely. Law and order reigned
          and, according to Fa Hien, incidents of theft and burglary were rare.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The following also speaks volumes about the prudence of the Gupta
          kings. Samudragupta acquired a far greater part of southern India than
          he cared to incorporate into his empire. Therefore, in quite a few
          cases, he returned the kingdom to the original kings and was satisfied
          only with collecting taxes from them. He reckoned that the great
          distance between that part of the country and his capital Pataliputra
          would hinder the process of good governance.

      <div class="margin-hr">
        <h3 class="secondary-heading-b">Socio-economic Conditions</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          People led a simple life. Commodities were affordable and all round
          prosperity ensured that their requirements were met easily. They
          preferred vegetarianism and shunned alcoholic beverages. Gold and
          silver coins were issued in great numbers which is a general
          indicative of the health of the economy. Trade and commerce flourished
          both within the country and outside. Silk, cotton, spices, medicine,
          priceless gemstones, pearl, precious metal and steel were exported by
          sea. Highly evolved steelcraft led everyone to a belief that Indian
          iron was not subject to corrosion. The 7 m (23 ft) high Iron Pillar in
          Qutub complex, Delhi, built around 402 CE, is a testimony to this
          fact. Trade relations with Middle East improved. Ivory, tortoise shell
          etc. from Africa, silk and some medicinal plants from China and the
          Far East were high on the list of imports. Food, grain, spices, salt,
          gems and gold bullion were primary commodities of inland trade

        <p class="paragraph">
          After the demise of his father Chandragupta II, 
          Kumaragupta I (circa 415 – 455 CE) ruled over the vast empire with skill and ability. He was able to maintain peace 
          and even fend off strong challenges from a tribe known as Pushyamitra. He was helped by his able son Skandagupta (455 – 467 CE)
           who was the last of the sovereign rulers of the Gupta Dynasty. He also succeeded in preventing the invasion of the Huns (Hephthalites).
            Skandagupta was a great scholar and wise ruler. For the well being of the denizens he carried out several construction works including the rebuilding
           of a dam on Sudarshan Lake, Gujarat. But these were the last of the glory days of the empire.
          </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          After Skandagupta's death the dynasty became embroiled with domestic conflicts. 
          The rulers lacked the capabilities of the earlier emperors to rule over such a large kingdom. 
          This resulted in a decline in law and order. They were continuously plagued by the attacks of the Huns and other foreign powers.
           This put a dent in the economic well-being of the empire. On top of this, the kings remained more occupied with self-indulgence than
            in preparing to meet with the challenges of their enemies. The inept ministers and administrative heads also followed suit. 
            Notably, after the defeat and capture of Mihirakula, one of the most important Hephthalite emperors of the time, Gupta King Baladitya 
            set him free on the advice of his ministers. The Huns came back to haunt the empire later and finally drew the curtains on this 
            illustrious empire in circa 550. The following lines of King Sudraka's Mricchakatika (The Little Clay Cart) aptly sum up the rise 
            and fall in the fortune of the Gupta Dynasty.
          </p>
