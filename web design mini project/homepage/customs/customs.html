            The Aghori sadhus are wondering monks who renounce all earthly
            possessions in order to attain eternal spiritual liberation. These
            ascetic Shaiva sadhus engage in post-mortem rituals such as
            meditating on corpses, cannibalism, keeping skulls as reminders of
            the impermanence of life, and smearing their bodies with ash, which
            is the last rite performed on a material body. Another vital ritual
            is a dip in the Ganges before sunrise, to cleanse themselves of all
            sins.

              Year and is held in the small town of Anandpur Sahib in Punjab,
              turning it into a rambunctious carnival setting. It showcases the
              fierce martial arts of Nihang Sikhs, as well as kirtan (religious
              chants), music and poetry, and ends with a glorious military-style
              procession.

            Buddhist chanting is celebrated every day in monasteries and
            villages in Ladakh. Buddhist lamas (priests) chant and recite the
            teachings and philosophy of Lord Buddha for the spiritual and moral
            well-being of believers. The ritual is carried out in groups—monks
            don traditional attire and make use of bells, drums, cymbals, and
            trumpets.

              classical Chhau dance, from Odisha. The dance is used as a form of
              storytelling on stage, using vivacious all-male troupes. It
              combines martial arts, acrobatics, athletics and its motifs
              highlight religious themes of Shaivism, Shaktism, and Vaishnavism.
              This folk dance is egalitarian and is celebrated every spring.

          Also celebrated in countries such as Sri Lanka, Singapore, and
          Malaysia, Thimithi originated in Tamil Nadu. The festival takes place
          every year during the months of October and November in honour of
          Draupati Amman, the wife of the five Pandava brothers in the
          Mahabharata. Male devotees perform the ritual by walking on a sheet of
          burning coal while carrying a pot of milk or water on their heads for
          balance. The practice is a sign of utter devotion to their faith.

            narrated in different mythologies and folklore, including in the
            Mahabharata, the Sanskrit epic. On this day, serpent deities made
            out of silver, wood or stone are worshipped with offerings of milk,
            sweets and flowers, and sometimes a real snake is used. It is also
            considered a taboo to dig the earth on Nag Panchami as it could harm
            the snakes.

              During the monsoon season in the middle of June, Ambubachi Hindu
              Mela (festival) is celebrated annually in the honour of Devi
              Kamakhya at the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, Assam. The festival
              celebrates yearly menstrual cycle of Devi Kamakhya aka the Mother
              of Shakti (power), who represents the nurturing power of a fertile
              land. The temple is closed for three days during the festival, as
              it is believed that Mother Earth becomes unclean during her
              period. Post its purification, the temple is re-opened, Kamakhya
              is bathed and Prasad is offered. Since there is no idol of Devi
              Kamakhya, a yoni-shaped stone is cleaned with water and covered in
              red cloth.

            Translating as “hitting with sticks,’’ the festival is celebrated
            before Holi in the neighbouring towns of Nandgaon and Barsana near
            Mathura. This distinct style of Holi celebration is limited to these
            towns because of a legend. According to the legend, Lord Krishna of
            Nandgaon visited his beloved Radha in Barsana on this day and the
            women playfully chased him away using lathis (long staves). The
            celebratory gesture is reciprocated the next day, by the men of
            Barsana invading the town of Nandgaon.

              Many have called Kashmir heaven on earth, but only those who have
              visited know that there’s so much more to the region than
              otherworldly valleys and pashmina shawls. Wazwan is less a cuisine
              and more a tradition among Kashmiris. It is art served on a traem
              (platter) that involves a 36-course meal. The dishes are cooked
              overnight under the supervision of a master chef, a vaste waze.
              Guests sit in the group of four and share from one traem. Kashmiri
              Muslims invoke the name of Allah before feasting, whereas Kashmiri
              Brahmins pray to Lord Rudra.

            The Kumbh Mela (fair) is the world’s largest congregation of
            religious pilgrims. It rotates between these four pilgrimage
            destinations in a 12-year cycle: Haridwar, Allahabad, Nashik, and
            Ujjain. The last Kumbh Mela was held at Ujjain in 2016 and the next
            one will happen in 2022 at Haridwar. The main devotees are the Naga
            sadhus. Their solitary and extremely harsh lifestyle revolves around
            a monastic way of living. The significance of the fair for Hindus is
            to cleanse their sins by bathing in sacred waters.
