        <p class="paragraph">
          India, the name comes from the Indus valley. Before India, it is known
          as Bharata, it is used to designate the country in the constitution.
          The name Bharat came from the ancient mythological emperor Bharata,
          according to history Bharat conquered and rule the whole subcontinent
          of India, therefore, the people of India are called Bharatvasi. In
          this article, we have included the three major periods of History of
          India, ancient Indian History, Medieval Indian History, and Modern
          Indian History.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In the 3rd millennium, a local species millet was domesticated in the
          south of India by former hunter-gatherers. Also around that time,
          local species of wild rice were hybridized with domesticated rice from
          China, allowing farming to spread into the Ganges Valley. As a result,
          the region's population is primarily descended from the Middle Eastern
          farmers and the earlier South Asian hunter-gatherers, but there have
          been other groups who migrated to the region since.

          The Indus River Valley Civilizations
        </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Around 2800 BC, a new civilization rose along the banks of the Indus
          river (just like other early civilizations, along a river) in India.
          The place in which it arose was largely ideal, and was well-protected
          by the natural boundaries of the Hindu Kush Mountains. Although this
          limited outside contact, it is known that the early Indians used the
          Khyber pass through this range to communicate with other
          civilizations. In the future, groups would use this same pass to
          invade India.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Two major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization have been
          discovered: Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. These two cities developed at
          the same time as those in Egypt and Mesopotamia, but were much larger.
          Together they might have contained 100,000 people and the Civilization
          may have been as large as 5 million. These cities show remarkable
          organization, and the civilization seems to be the first to have
          developed urban central-planning. There were well-organized wastewater
          drainage systems, trash collection systems, and possibly even public
          granaries and baths. Most city-dwellers were artisans and merchants.
          The civilization developed the first accurate system of standardized
          weights and measures, some as accurate as to 0.001 millimeters. The
          Indus Valley peoples were adept at using metals as well, showing
          sophisticated use of bronz e, tin, copper, and lead.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Indus Valley economy was driven largely by trade. They use
          bull-driven carts to carry goods across distances. The same carts are
          still used throughout South Asia today. The Indus peoples developed
          boats, which possibly had sails. In addition, archaeologists have
          discovered a massive, dredged canal and docking facility at the
          coastal city of Lothal.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In spite of the many achievements of the Indus Valley Civilization, we
          know very little about them. Their system of writing, the Indus
          Script, remains undecipherable. We know next to nothing about their
          use of agriculture, except that they must have used the river's flood
          deposits and must have had a large agricultural surplus. We have no
          conclusive evidence about how they were ruled, nor of kings, priests,
          armies, temples, or palaces. Although the cities contained massive
          "citadels" their purpose seems largely defensive, even possibly used
          for floodwater diversion. Scientists do not even know what the Indus
          Valley peoples called themselves. Also, we do not know what caused
          their sudden collapse, beginning circa 1900 BC. What we do know is
          that the people of the Indus Valley Civilization did develop a
          massive, well-organized, and highly advanced civilization.

        <h3 class="secondary-heading-b">The Aryans and the Vedic Culture</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Around 1800 to 1500 BC, a group of nomadic peoples known as the Aryans
          traveled from Central Asia to the Indian Subcontinent, probably
          through the Khyber Pass. Unlike previous tribes in the region, they
          could ride horses and wheeled vehicles, which gave them a military
          advantage. The Aryans were the opposite of the Indus River Valley
          Civilization, in that they left behind voluminous amounts of written
          and decipherable information but that there are almost no
          archaeological remains to examine. It is not clear if their arrival
          had any role in the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The Aryans brought with them a system of polytheistic beliefs. Their
          culture gave rise to the Vedic Culture, whose beliefs were based in a
          collection of texts called the Vedas and the Upanishads. They spoke
          Sanskrit, a language which is the ancestor of most modern Indian
          languages and a major source of words for others. As they did not have
          writing, they instead had people who were trained to recite them very
          accurately. Even as the languages of India changed, the reciters tried
          to keep the old pronunciation as much as possible. Although they have
          since been written down, this tradition of oral transmission continues
          today.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Over many centuries, these beliefs would evolve into the religion
          known as Hinduism. One part of the Vedic religion was the belief in
          class divisions, which became the forerunner to the Indian caste
          system. Originally, the caste system was divided into three classes:
          the warriors on top, the priests in the middle, and the broad mass of
          the population, the peasants, on the bottom. Eventually, a class of
          landowners and merchants was created above the peasantry, and the
          priests, known as Brahmans (not to be confused with Brahman, the Hindu
          "oversoul"), were elevated above the warriors. However, it was
          different to later versions of the caste system. For example, there
          were no "untouchables" and people could move between classes.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Among other oral texts of the Vedic civilization were Aṣṭādhyāyī, a
          guide to Sanskrit grammar by a scholar called Pāṇini. This is one of
          the first times that anyone described a language's grammar in detail.
