            India is a land of ancient civilizations. India's social, economic,
            and cultural configurations are the products of a long process of
            regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the
            Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two
            phases are usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic age.
            Hinduism arose in the Vedic period.

            The fifth-century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, who had
            converted to Buddhism, and it is in his reign that Buddhism spread
            in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam came to India
            for the first time and by the eleventh century had firmly
            established itself in India as a political force. It resulted in the
            formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded by the
            Mughal Empire, under which India once again achieved a large measure
            of political unity.

            It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This
            coincided with the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, paving the
            way for regional states. In the contest for supremacy, the English
            emerged 'victors'. The Rebellion of 1857-58, which sought to restore
            Indian supremacy, was crushed; and with the subsequent crowning of
            Victoria as Empress of India, the incorporation of India into the
            empire was complete. It was followed by India's struggle for
            independence, which we got in the year 1947. Here is a brief
            timeline about the history of India:

        <p class="main-heading-2">The Indus Valley Civilization:</p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          A long time ago, in the eastern world, there rose a few civilizations.
          The main reasons for the rise of these urban civilizations were access
          to rivers, which served various functions of human beings. Along with
          the Mesopotamian civilization and the Egyptian civilization, rose the
          Indus Valley civilization spanning Northwest India and modern-day
          Pakistan. The largest amongst the three civilizations, the Indus
          Valley civilization flourished around 2600 BC, at which time
          agriculture in India started flourishing. The fertile Indus valley
          made it possible for agriculture to be carried out on a large scale.
          The most well-known towns of the Indus Valley in today’s date are
          Mohenjo Daro and Harappa. Unearthing these two towns showed excavators
          glimpses into the richness of the Indus Valley civilization, evidenced
          in ruins and things like household articles, war weapons, gold and
          silver ornament - and so on. The people of the Indus Valley
          civilization lived in well-planned towns and well-designed houses made
          of baked bricks. In an era of developments and prosperity,
          civilization, unfortunately, came to an end by around 1300 BC, mainly
          due to natural calamities.
        </p>
        <p class="main-heading-2">Vedic Civilization:</p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          The next era that India saw was that of the Vedic civilization,
          flourishing along the river Saraswati, named after the Vedas, which
          depict the early literature of the Hindus. The two greatest epics of
          this period were the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, still held in great
          reverence by the followers of Hinduism.
        </p>
        <p class="main-heading-2">Buddhist Era:</p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          Next came the Buddhist era, during the time of the Mahajanapadas which
          were the sixteen great powers, during the 7th and the 6th centuries
          BC. Prominent powers at the time were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu and
          the Licchavis of Vaishali. Buddha, whose original name was Siddhartha
          Gautam, was born in Lumbini near Kapilavastu and was the founder of
          Buddhism - a religion based on spiritualism. He died at the age of 80
          in 480 BC but his teachings spread throughout southern and eastern
          Asia and are followed across the world today.

          Macedonians had never seen before. Alexander then took over the lands

          The Gupta period has been referred to as the Golden Age of Indian
          history. When Chandragupt I received the gift of Pataliputra in dowry
          when he married the daughter of the chief of the ‘Licchavis’, he
          started to lay down the foundation of his empire, which extended from
          the river Ganges or the Ganga to the city of Allahabad. He ruled for
          15 years and was also referred to as the ‘king of kings’ for his
          strategic conquests and the flourishing state of India.

          eventually got defeated by the Chalukya Kingdom of Deccan India.
          Harshavardhana was well-known for establishing relations with the
          Chinese, and also for having high religious tolerance and strong
          administrative capabilities.

        <p class="main-heading-2">Medieval Indian History:</p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          The medieval history of India is renowned for deriving a lot of its
          character from Islamic kingdoms. Extending across almost three
          generations, medieval India included a number of kingdoms and
          dynasties:

          <li>- The Cholas</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="brief-history">
          The Cholas were the most important rulers at this time, the 9th
          Century AD. Their kingdom covered a large part of South India,
          including Sri Lanka and the Maldives. While the rulers ruled bravely
          and carried out the annexation of multiple territories in India, the
          empire came to an end in the 14th Century AD with an invasion by a man
          named Kafur Malik. The monuments from the Chola Dynasty are still
          intact and are known for their rustic charm.
        </p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          The next major empire was that of the Mughals, preceded by a rise in
          Islamic rulers. The invasion of Timur was a significant point in
          Indian history before a Hindu revival movement called the Bhakti
          movement, came to be. Finally, in the 16th Century, the Mughal empire
          started to rise. One of the greatest empires of India, the Mughal
          empire was a rich and glorious one, with the whole of India united and
          ruled by one monarch. The Mughal Kings were Babar, Humayun, Sher Shah
          Suri (not a Mughal king), Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb.
          They were responsible for setting up efficient public administration,
          laying out infrastructure, and promoting the arts. A large number of
          monuments in India today exist from the Mughal period. The death of
          the last Mughal King, Aurangzeb, sowed the seeds of disintegration
          within India. Influencers of Islamic architecture in India, the Mughal
          kings are still looked back in awe.

          Emperor Akbar, also known as Akbar the Great or Jalaluddin Muhammad
          Akbar, was the third emperor of the Mughal Empire, after Babur and
          Humayun. He was the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and succeeded him as the
          emperor in the year 1556 when he was only 13 years old.

          the fifth Mughal ruler, after Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Jahangir.
          Shah Jahan succeeded the throne after revolting against his father,

          Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in
          western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of
          his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a
          part of the folklore. King Shivaji used the guerrilla tactics to
          capture a part of, the then, dominant Mughal empire.

        <p class="main-heading-2">Modern Indian History:</p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          During the late 16th and the 17th Centuries, the European trading
          companies in India competed with each other ferociously. By the last
          quarter of the 18th Century, the English had outdone all others and
          established themselves as the dominant power in India. The British
          administered India for a period of about two centuries and brought
          about revolutionary changes in the social, political and economic life
          of the country.
        </p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          However, the zenith of colonisation was achieved when the British
          arrived in the early 1600s as traders. Capitalizing on the
          disintegration that existed in India after the Mughal rule, the
          British actively used the strategy of ‘divide-and-rule’ to rule over
          India for over 2 centuries. While the British had come in earlier,
          they only achieved political power in 1757 AD after the Battle of
          Plassey.

        <p class="brief-history">
          They took a keen interest in the resources that India had to offered
          and have been looked back at as plunderers of India’s wealth of
          resources - as they took cotton, spices, silk, and tea, amongst
          numerous other resources. While they did lay out a massive chunk of
          India’s infrastructure, by also bringing the Indians steam engines, it
          is seldom looked back at as an equal relationship. The British Raj was
          divisive and pit Indians against one another, on the basis of
          religion; and also mistreated the laborers. The Indians were
          essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without
          any returns on their work. This, naturally, led to multiple mutinies;
          and prominent freedom fighters came to the forefront. Different
          ideologies of thought believed that there were different ways of
          gaining freedom; however, they all had one common goal - freedom.
        </p>
        <p class="brief-history">
          The British queen had asserted that the aim of the British was to help
          India progress - however, multiple problems arose without the
          consultation of Indian leaders. One important instance of this was
          when in the First World War, Britain launched an attack on Germany on
          behalf of India, even though India did not wish for that to happen;
          and millions of Indian soldiers were at the forefront of the British
          Indian Army during both the world wars - further fuelling the Indian
          resistance. Over a million Indian soldiers were killed in both the
          World Wars.
